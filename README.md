# pygamepoint
Use pygame like it was a presentation tool for images like powerpoint
Simply put the images 800x600 into the slides folder.
Give the a name like 001.png, 002.png to give them the desired order.
Run the pygamepoint.py file.

If you do not have pygame, install it with pip.
For me it's good this pygame version for pygame 3.8
pip install pygame==2.0.0.dev10

There could be new versions of pygame. Check it on the web.
It should work fine also with the 1.9.6 version of pygame.
